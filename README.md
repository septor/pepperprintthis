# Pepper Print This

My wife watches kids for a living. Those kids like to color. A lot. I started gathering coloring pages online to print off for them all to color. It got out of control. I made [a script](https://github.com/septor/gallery) to display all those coloring sheets. However, it took time to load each page. The kids did not have time for that garbage.

I switched gears and decided to lean into [Isotope](https://isotope.metafizzy.co/) to make things easier. Now things are faster.

## Information

This project supports the following image formats `jpg,gif,png,jpeg,svg,webp`. You can add more on line 4 of `index.php`. This is set up so your images are in categories and/or subcategories. Following the following directory structure: `images/category/image.ext` or `images/category/subcategory/image.ext`. Everything should populate after that just fine.

## Bugs, etc.

Submit an issue. No feature requests will be handled as the project handles my needs just fine (for now).
